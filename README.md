# 27 Nakshatras

**27 Nakshatras** is an interactive web-based project that visualizes the emotional, spiritual, and psychological qualities of the 27 lunar constellations (Nakshatras) in Vedic astrology.

## What This Is

This is a personal and educational project built to explore and visualize classical Vedic knowledge. It aims to inspire curiosity and make the Nakshatra system easier to understand. The approach goes beyond zodiac signs and includes ruling planets (Grahas), life goals (Purusharthas), energy qualities (Gunas), and behavioral types (Ganas).

## Features

• Interactive diagram of all 27 Nakshatras  
• Detailed info panels for each Nakshatra  
• Planetary rulerships with classical references  
• Layered traits: Guna, Gana, and Purushartha  
• Learn more panels on Grahas, Gunas, Ganas, and Purusharthas  
• Rooted in mythological and scriptural context

## References

This work is based primarily on the following classical texts:

• *Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra*  
• *Phaladeepika*

These texts describe the qualities of the planets and Nakshatras, as well as their mythological and karmic significance.

## Purpose

The goal is to create a tool that makes Vedic astrology more accessible, especially the lesser-known lunar side of the tradition. While it is a personal project, it may serve as a helpful reference for others exploring these ideas for the first time.
